This is an online generator which converts normal text letters into tiny letters
which you can copy and paste into facebook, twitter, instagram and other social 
media posts and status updates. It essentially allows you to make text smaller.
The text looks so small because three special unicode alphabets are used. This 
is why you can copy and paste it! You wouldn't be able to do that if it were a 
tiny font.
